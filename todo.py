ðŸ”¹ What is __name__ in Python?
Every Python file (module) has a special built-in variable called __name__.

When a Python file is:

run directly, Python sets __name__ to "__main__".

imported into another file, __name__ is set to the module's name (i.e., the file name without .py).

Example:
Suppose you have a file named todo.py:

Case 1: Run directly

bash
Copy
Edit
$ python todo.py
Then inside todo.py, __name__ == "__main__" will be True.

Case 2: Imported in another file

python
Copy
Edit
import todo
Then inside todo.py, __name__ == "todo" (i.e., the module name), not "__main__".

ðŸ”¹ Why do we use if __name__ == "__main__":?
We use it to ensure that certain code runs only when the file is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module.

So:

python
Copy
Edit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This line checks: "Is this script being run directly?"

If yes, it calls the main() function to start the program.

If the script is imported in another file, the main() function won't run automatically.

ðŸ”¹ Why is this useful?
It lets you write reusable code. Example:

python
Copy
Edit
# todo.py
def main():
    print("This is the main To-Do List app")

def helper():
    print("This is a helper function")
Now if you run todo.py directly, you want main() to execute.
But if someone imports todo.py to reuse helper(), you donâ€™t want the whole app to run automatically.

By using:

python
Copy
Edit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
You avoid that problem.

âœ… Summary
Part	Meaning
__name__	A special variable that holds the name of the current module.
"__main__"	The value of __name__ when the script is run directly.
if __name__ == "__main__":	Ensures the code block runs only if the file is executed directly, not when imported.
